# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have believe to have found a vulnerability in my action or related packages, please contact me immediately by emailing `security@ryand.ca` or messaging my [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@ryand56:matrix.ryand.ca) to disclose a potential security vulnerability. If it is a package that is related, that package will be updated immediately (if there is an update) and a new release will be pushed.
